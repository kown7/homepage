----------
title: Dried Yuzu Slices
----------

After shaving off the peel to make drinks I'm left with naked Yuzus. I don't know what to do with them. A recent visit to [Steiereck](https://www.steirereck.at) gave the idea to dry them coated with a sugar syrup.

The recipe is based on [this inspiration](https://shortgirltallorder.com/how-to-dry-citrus).

Cut the Yuzus into thin slices. It helps of they are frozen as not to squish them.

Take the left over sugar syrup from your recent limoncello (700g per 1l water). Pour a few drops on ever slice, possibly with a pipette.

Put it in a convection oven for around 4h at around 70Â°C.

Enjoy as they are
