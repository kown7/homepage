title: Astro on Cloudflare Pages with Functions
----------

Migrating our family cottage away from a Wordpress site to something
homegrown. 

Aims:

* Booking system with custom rules
* Track everything in git
* [Astro](https://astro.build/) as a framework

# Astro

It's a static site generator.

# Cloudflare Pages

Free hosting for your static site. Use *Basic Auth* protected by 
*Functions* as described here: 
<https://github.com/garrison/cloudflare-pages-shared-password>.

Functions to serverlessy process the bookings.

# Wordpress

Keep a local copy though:
