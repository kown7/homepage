title: VHDL bits and pieces
--------------------

Things I've discovered and considered relevant at the time.

# Access Keyword

One way to handle variable length strings is to use access pointers as
defined here: http://vhdl.renerta.com/mobile/source/vhd00001.htm

Assigning a new string goes as follows.

    type str_ptr is access string;
    variable myString str_ptr;
    myString := string'("hello world");

# Conditional Writeline

or how to handle lines written as debug messages in case they're not
needed. We don't want to create memory leaks, don't we?

    variable lineOut : line;
    if someBoolean then
      write(fh, lineOut);
      else
        deallocate(lineOut);
        end if;

The source is

# Delay Model

The VHDL delay model has a few quirks when it comes to delayed
assignments. If in the following examples

    q1<=r nor nq after 1ns;
    q2<=transport r nor nq after 1ns;

nq has a spike shorter than 1 nanosecond, only q2 will see the change. A
more thorough explanation can be found
